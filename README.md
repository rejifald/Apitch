# Stitchapi

Stitchapi is a simple and powerful open-source library designed to help developers create functions (stitches) for calling any API and convert them into plain JavaScript/TypeScript functions that return data. This library aims to simplify the process of building API clients and adding layer of abstraction.

## Features

- **URL Templates** - Using [RFC 6570 URI Template specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6570).
- **Response unwrap** - Return actual data immediately.
- **Built-in query string** - Using [qs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs) library under the hood for building query strings.
